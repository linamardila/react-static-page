        On a boring afternoon, young Alice spots a White Rabbit wearing a waistcoat and muttering about being late. Curious, she follows him down a rabbit hole and tumbles into a strange, magical world called Wonderland. There, she discovers bottles labeled "Drink Me" that make her shrink, and cakes labeled "Eat Me" that make her grow to enormous sizes.

        Throughout her journey, Alice encounters peculiar characters including the grinning Cheshire Cat who can disappear at will, a Mad Hatter hosting a never-ending tea party, and a tyrannical Queen of Hearts who constantly shouts "Off with their heads!" Alice tries to make sense of Wonderland's nonsensical rules, but everything seems upside-down and backwards.

        After a chaotic croquet game with flamingo mallets and hedgehog balls, and a bizarre trial where she's called as a witness, Alice suddenly wakes up on the riverbank. She realizes her entire adventure was just a dream, though the memories of Wonderland's curious inhabitants remain vivid in her mind.
